const setting = `far in the future of Earth after Magic has returned to the world. In the not-so-distant past, there was a great war between the forces aligned with the ideals of scientific knowledge and the forces of magic and religion where the forces of science lost the war and nearly all modern technology has been lost, returning the world to a pre-industrial revolution level of technology supplemented with magic being commonplace. The remnants of the science faction still remain along with their leader, a powerful manipulator by the name of Vexilus. The campaign will center around giving the players choices between what faction they want to support as they continue to struggle with each other in the aftermath.
\nThe Science faction is officially known as the "Rationalists," and the Magic faction is known as "The Enlightened." As Co-DM, your role is to help shape the story and guide the players through this world as they navigate the complex political and social landscape. What challenges will the players face, and what consequences will their choices have on the world around them?`
